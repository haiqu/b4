#+TITLE: The b4 programming language.

*b4* is a tiny concatenative programming language, a bit like forth, but with a strong bias toward stepwise refinement and interactive media (like games).

* Orientation

B4 is a forth-like language. Quick *intros to forth* (free and online):

B4 runs on an implementation of the *ngaro virtual machine*, stolen from retroforth. We'll probably steal more from retro, but B4 isn't retroforth. It's something different.

Many versions of ngaro exist, and B4 should work with any. We're writing a new one from scratch, using the *object pascal* languange and the free pascal compiler.
