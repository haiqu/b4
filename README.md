# The b4 programming language. #

*b4* is a tiny concatenative programming language, a bit like forth, but with a strong bias toward stepwise refinement and interactive media (like games).

It is an open source project being created right now (Aug 2 2012), over 32 hours, just in time for the 48 hour [bacon game jam](http://bacongamejam.org/jams/bacongamejam-02/).

## Orientation ##

B4 is a forth-like language. Quick *intros to forth* (free and online):

 * [Programming a Problem-Oriented Language](http://www.colorforth.com/POL.htm)
 * [Starting Forth](http://www.forth.com/starting-forth/) 

B4 runs on an implementation of the *ngaro virtual machine*, stolen from retroforth. We'll probably steal more from retro, but B4 isn't retroforth. It's something different.

 * [ngaro virtual machine reference](http://retroforth.org/docs/The_Ngaro_Virtual_Machine.html)
 * [retroforth](http://retroforth.org/)

Many versions of ngaro exist, and B4 should work with any. We're writing a new one from scratch, using the *object pascal* languange and the free pascal compiler.
