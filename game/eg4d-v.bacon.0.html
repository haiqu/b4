         What? You thought there'd be some PRE text here? Heck no!
         It was just a PRE-TEXT to get you to look at the source!

         Actually, al the text is rendered dynamically by a new
         color terminal we made for the ngaro virtual machine.

         You can read all about ngaro here:

             http://rx-core.org/docs/The_Ngaro_Virtual_Machine.html

         The code for the terminal is in ngterm.js

         The machine itself is in ngaro.js ( although the version
         here is sort of an experimental one ).

         There are a bunch of other versions of ngaro, written in
         lots of different languages. You can find them inside the
         distribution for the programming language retro:

         "BUT WHAT OF ERNIE GOLDSMILE?" you say? Alas, Poor Ernie
         is still stranded in the forth dimension, but Ernie's
         story is not over.

         We ran out of time for the bacon jam, but the game is still
         on! We're working on it over in http://reddit.com/r/b4lang , the
         official subreddit of a brand new programming language called
         B4 - which aims to be a pretty good "Beginner" version of
         a very unusual programming language called forth.

         To learn more, swing by /r/b4lang , or come visit us
         in the #b4 channel on irc.freenode.net.

         Not sure we're talking to YOU? Well, we are!

         Both B4 and "Ernie Goldsmile in the Forth Dimension" are
         ( or soon will be ) part of /r/lpmc , the /r/learnprogramming
         mentoring community.

         Anyone who's interested is invited to take part, even if
         you've never written a line of code before in your life.

         Thanks for reading.

         PS: well played, bacon jammers... WELL PLAYED. I look forward
         to trying all the bacon games, but just so you know:

         Next time, ALL THE BACON WILL BE OURS! ;)

  <div id="pre-text">Seriously? That's not even a game!
    It's just a bunch of &lt;pre&gt; text... Isn't it?

  <script type="text/javascript">

    // this is just how jquery says, "do something when the page loads"
    $( function() {

      // here, we're telling jquery to take the canvas
      // that ngarojs creates and stick it inside the
      // DIV above. ( The one with the message. )
      $( "#ngterm" ).append( $( ngterm.canvas ));
