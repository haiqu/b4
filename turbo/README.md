B4:Turbo Pascal Edition
=======================

This directory contains a simple implementation of the B4 environment
in turbo pascal 5.5 for MS-DOS (which you can [download for free](
http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20803) and run either on an old
dos/windows box or inside [dosbox](http://www.dosbox.com/)).

With a few minor tweaks, this code should run under free pascal
as well, but I haven't tested it yet.

features
--------

 + stack based virtual machine (ub4.pas)
 + assembler (ub4a.pas)
 + visual debugger (b4.pas)
 + test suite (testb4a.pas)
 + a small imperative testing framework (tptester.pas)
