#+TITLE: help wanted

* NOTE about this file
** ~[#A]~ is easy, ~[#B]~ medium, ~[#C]~ advanced
** i'm working through file:b4.00.tasklist.org from top to bottom
*** usually discover i need something out of order though
*** probably best to chat on freenode/#b4 if you want to work on main tasklist


* TODO licensing issues?
- if you contribute / port something, make sure license is MIT/ [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license][ISC]] compatible ([[http://retroforth.org/license.html][retroforth license]] is ISC)
- [[http://www.freepascal.org/faq.var#general-license][freepascal]] license notes


* Things b4 will need soon

** assembler in pascal
*** probably similar to  [[https://github.com/oriontransfer/PL0-Language-Tools/blob/master/pl0_assemblera.py][pl/0 language tools assembler.py]]
**** [#A] not clear what license is. author seems like nice guy. ask?
**** [#B] port to pascal, or write our own. (should be small code)

** need to be in ngaro assembly language
*** database (b4 has tiny relational database)
**** [#C] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree][b-tree]] or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree][b+-tree]] implementation                           :nga:
**** [#A] codd's 8 relational operators                              :nga:

There is psuedocode for all 8 here.

*** [#A] recode the font from [[http://256.io/escapes.js/][escapes.js]] 

*** [#B] repl - probably follow itsyforth model
**** [#A] track down itsyforth license - ask john metcalf?

* forth-like code
** NOTE if you write in python, module [[http://docs.python.org/library/dis.html][dis]] converts to stack-based code
** NOTE if you write the code in ANS forth we can (hopefully) translate directly
** NOTE retro / joy / factor / ngaro


* Things that would just be nice to have
** emacs mode for colorforth-like languages

B4 is a a colorized language: you syntax-highlight it yourself, to simplify the parser, and words change meaning (verb tense) based on color.

This looks promising:

** render org-files to something more readable.                      :elisp:
*** github makes org-code ugly
*** [#A] org itself does better job... make me a macro?
