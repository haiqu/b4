* Pask

This is another prototype Pascal compiler.

Pask is written by John Earnest. John has a bunch of other interesting things here:

-- including his own virtual machine and forth implementation, on which he's built various games and language interpreters. Really cool stuff! :)

Anyway, I told him about the winfield83 paper, and he was kind enough to share this.
